# DAU_MAU
BigQuery_Floodit
In this project I used database "floodit" dataset available through the "firebase-public-project".
In definition folder there are three files
- declaration_floodit.sqlx -  Where is declared public data set 
- operation_floodit.sqlx - quiery to prepare preprocessed data, delete NULLs and dublicates
- DAUMAU.sqlx - Query where based on our set we found DAU(Daily Active Users), MAU (Monthly Active Users) and a ratio.

  As a result we have two visualizations
  First one built in Looker
  [Looker_Studio_Reporting_-_10_11_23,_6_34â€¯PM.pdf](https://github.com/IrinaBogorad/DAU_MAU/files/13250810/Looker_Studio_Reporting_-_10_11_23._6_34.PM.pdf)
  and the second visualisation built in Tableau
